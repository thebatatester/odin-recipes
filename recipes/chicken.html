        <h1>Fired Chicken</h1>

        <p>Fired Chicken is a delicious meal that is needed in every house hold. The big problem, is that not every one knows how to make it. In all honesty there are only three easy steps but, lets get the what we need.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Chicken:</em></strong> We use the whole bird instead of buying individual chicken pieces. Cutting up a whole chicken creates a nice assortment of white and dark meat while also ensuring all the pieces are cut into even sizes.</li>
            <li><strong><em>The batter:</em></strong> We tackle the chicken coating in two steps. First, there’s a batter of flour, eggs and water. This evenly coats the chicken and prevents the breading from falling off. Next, we dip the chicken in seasoned flour, which helps the chicken become as crispy as possible when it hits the hot oil.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Seasonings:</em></strong> We use a flavorful mixture of garlic salt, paprika, black pepper and poultry seasoning. This blend includes dried sage, thyme, rosemary, marjoram and nutmeg. If you don’t have garlic salt on hand, mix your own by combining one part garlic powder with three parts salt (i.e., one teaspoon garlic powder and three teaspoons salt).</li>
            <li><strong><em>Oil:</em></strong> The best oils for frying are neutral oils, like canola and peanut oil. Their higher smoke points make them ideal for frying chicken and other foods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps To Make</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large shallow dish, combine 2-2/3 cups of the flour with the garlic salt, paprika, 2-1/2 teaspoons of the pepper and the poultry seasoning. In a separate shallow dish, briefly beat the eggs with the water before adding the salt, remaining 1-1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>Dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture and then into the flour mixture. Turn each piece until it is fully coated.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to 375°F in an electric skillet or deep-fat fryer. Fry the chicken a few pieces at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear, about seven to eight minutes per side. Drain the chicken on a paper towel-lined plate or wire rack.</li>
            
        </ol>
