    <h2 class="all h2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="all">
        <li><strong><em>Cheese Filling:</em></strong> For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
        <p><li><strong><em>Meat:</em></strong> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li></p>
        <p><li><strong><em>Sauce:</em></strong> To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li></p>
    </ul>
